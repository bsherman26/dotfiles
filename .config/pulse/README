The configuration files in this directory were copied from /etc/pulse/

   - client.conf
   - daemon.conf
   - default.pa

Available audio devices can be found using:

    $> pacmd list-cards

# Changes:
#-------------------------------


- client.conf
    default-sink = alsa_output.pci-0000_04_00.6.analog-stereo
        - This stopped the system from initializing to the
          HDMI Monitor Speakers.


- default.pa
    load-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false

        - This was also added to the /etc/pulse/ version, but now that
          there are copies in /home/USER/.config/pulse/
          it is probably better just to have this here and
          leave the /default config file alone.

        - This line was added because chrome was having issues connecting.


- The below files were also manually edited:

	- fa0bbddce1c94b4e9bf125e72df8fa8f-default-sink
	- OLD.fa0bbddce1c94b4e9bf125e72df8fa8f-default-sink.OLD
