# GOOGLE CHROME EXCLUDES
# Folder where chrome is installed
#   Notes:
#     I decided this is important so that updates need to be performed on each
#     machine. Just in case changes are made to user configuration files during
#     updates.
/opt/google/chrome

# Notes:
#   These are just links to files in the above directory but I think they might
#   be used to determine if chrome is installed etc.
